# Intelligent-Fault-Diagnosis-in-UAV
The advancements of small UAVs necessitate intelligent approaches towards the issue of fault diagnosis. The hardware limitations for these small vehicles call for the usage of analytical redundancy to be implemented in contrast to the conventional hardware redundancy approach. An approach of implementing machine learning practices to diagnose faults on a quadcopter has been utilized which overcomes the burden needed in model-based fault analysis. In this study,first, a model of a quadcopter is simulated to generate data and test the designed algorithms. A supervised classification
method, SVM (Support Vector Machines) is used to classify the faulty and nominal flight conditions as well as to classify the type of failure. The features selected are the gyro and accelerometer measurements and the inputs to the four motors of the quadcopter. The faults considered are various actuator failures namely - locked-in place, loss of effectiveness, total system failure and hard-over fault. The training is held offline due to the need for labelled data. The results show that for simulated measurements, SVM gives an accuracy of 96% for binary classification and 95% for
multi-class classification.
