Understood the internal control system of a quadcopter and simulated five different
types of faults by making changes to the model. Selected the gyrometer and accelerometer
readings as the features and trained binary as well as multi-class Support Vector Machine
classifiers on the same for fault detection. Obtained an accuracy of 96% and 95% on the 
respective models.
